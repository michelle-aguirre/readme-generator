![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow)

  ## Description

  This application generates a README file automatically based on the users input.
  
  Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
  
  - What was your motivation?
  - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  - What problem does it solve?
  - What did you learn?
  
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
  
  If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
  
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [License](#license)
  
  ## Installation
  
  What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
  
npm i

  ## Usage

  [license](#license)
  
  Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

As a developer I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
 
  
  
  ## License

## License

MIT

  
  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

  🏆 The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
  
  ## Badges

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow)

MIT  

  
  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

  npm test
